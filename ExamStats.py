# MINI PROJECT: Create a program to compute stats

grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

# Write a function to print out the list of grades, one element at a time
def print_grades(grades_input):
  
  #iterate through list and print each item on its own line
  for i in grades_input:
    print i
